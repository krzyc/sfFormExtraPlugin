= sfFormExtraPlugin =

The `sfFormExtraPlugin` packages useful validators, widgets, and forms.

This collection holds validators, widgets, and forms which we don't want to include with the main symfony package
because they are too specific or have external dependencies.

    }}}

== Documentation ==

All classes have full API and usage documentation. The API documentation is available here.

== Forms ==

  * sfFormLanguage: A form to change the symfony user culture

== Validators ==

  * sfValidatorReCaptcha: Validates a ReCaptcha (see sfWidgetFormReCaptcha)
  * sfValidatorBlacklist: Validates that a value is not one of the configured forbidden ones

== Widgets ==
